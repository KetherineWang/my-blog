# Introduction

Have you ever wondered what separates a good movie from a truly great one? Why do some films stand the test of time, earning both critical acclaim and audience love? In addition to the data curation phase of the IMDb Top 250 Movies project discussed in last blog post, we now move on to the insights and interactivity phase. Building upon the curated dataset and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this blog post dives deeper into uncovering trends, exploring correlations, and providing an interactive platform to engage with the IMDb Top 250 Movies dataset.

The **motivating question of interest** that we are trying to answer is:
What are the defining features of highly-rated movies, and how do factors like genres, awards, ratings, and box office relate to their IMDb rankings?

By combining data analysis with interactive tools, I uncovered some interesting insights. Read on to learn what I found---and how you can explore the data yourself with the Streamlit app!

# Key Insights

## 1. Most Common Genres in IMDb Top 250 Movies

When we looked at the genres of IMDb’s Top 250 movies, one thing stood out: Drama dominates. It’s by far the most common genre, followed by Adventure, Crime, and Action. This suggests that audiences and critics tend to value emotional and story-driven films more than lighthearted or niche genres.

However, we also see that less common genres like Musical and Film-Noir still make the cut. This shows that while some genres are more likely to succeed, diversity plays a role in shaping what makes a movie truly great.

## 2. Correlation Analysis of Numerical Variables

We also looked at how different numerical factors—like ratings, box office earnings, and awards—relate to each other. A key finding is that movies with higher box office earnings tend to win more awards. There’s a moderate positive correlation (0.33) between Box Office and Total Wins, meaning commercial success often goes hand in hand with critical recognition.

Interestingly, we found only a weak connection (0.01) between IMDb Rating and Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer, suggesting audiences and critics don’t always agree. This shows that what makes a movie “great” depends on who you ask!
